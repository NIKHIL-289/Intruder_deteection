Intruder Detection System
Overview
This project is an Intruder Detection System designed to identify unauthorized access or suspicious activities. It leverages motion detection, sensors, or anomaly-based techniques to ensure security and trigger alerts when an intruder is detected.

Features
Real-time monitoring of activity.
Detection of intruders using [add detection method: motion sensors, AI, ML, etc.].
Automatic alerts or logging of suspicious activities.
Customizable thresholds and parameters.
Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: [e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, Numpy, etc.]

Future Improvements
Add facial recognition for better accuracy.
Integrate real-time notifications (e.g., SMS or email alerts).
Optimize performance with AI/ML models.
